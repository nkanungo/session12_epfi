Requirements
=================
Build a calculator package that has separate module for:
sin, cos, tan, tanh, SoftMax, Sigmoid, ReLU, log and e
The modules shall include their derivatives as well
If we do import calculator, we should be able to access all the above function (except deviratives)
For derivates we must do: from package import derivatives. 
Outputs are returned as well as printed using only f-string

sin Module
==========
Calculates the sin of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the sin of the given value 


cos Module
==========
Calculates the cos of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the cos of the given value 


tan Module
==========
Calculates the tan of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the tan of the given value 


tanh Module
==========
Calculates the tanh of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the tanh of the given value 

softmax Module
==========
Calculates the softmax of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the softmax of the given value 


Sigmoid Module
==========
Calculates the Sigmoid  of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the Sigmoid of the given value 


ReLU Module
==========
Calculates the ReLU of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the ReLU of the given value 


log Module
==========
Calculates the log of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the log of the given value 


exponential Module
====================
Calculates the exponential of the given value 
FInd out the derivative of the exponential of the given value
